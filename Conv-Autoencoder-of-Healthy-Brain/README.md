## Overview

Purpose: **Learn MRI representation for reconstruction**.

Image reconstruction which is a mainly sub-problem of image enhancement, could help to achieve better results in:

- Data acquisition
  - Reconstruct the image from less data collected: faster scanning process
- Disease detection and segmentation
  - Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
  - Tumor segmentation (BraTS)
- Data Augmentation
  - Construction of pathology-free image from abnormal and viceversa
  - Artifical MRI gGeneration
- Image Enhancement
  - Reconstruction of cropped parts
  - Reconstruction without noise and artifacts
  - Definition enhancement: from low resolution to high resolution.
